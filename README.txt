#Joe(04-20-2016): I would like to generate a machine learning/artificial intelligence based operating
#system. The goal would be to allow the operating system to take in voice and text inputs,
#then push vocal, text, or action based outputs. These actions would obviously rely both 
#on software and hardware functionality; however, the focus right now is generating a 
#semi-functional operating system.
